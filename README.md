# PhobiaX - VR-based Phobia Therapy

# PhobiaX - ml Module

PhobiaX is an Android-based application built using React Native, designed to educate and treat various types of phobias using Virtual Reality (VR). The app covers phobias like Aquaphobia (fear of water), Nyctophobia (fear of the dark), and Acrophobia (fear of heights). The project integrates a pre- and post-assessment to evaluate the effectiveness of the VR-based therapy and uses machine learning to predict the user's phobia level.
